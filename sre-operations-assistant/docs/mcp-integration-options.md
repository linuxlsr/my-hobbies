# MCP Integration Options Explained

## 7.1 Direct MCP Client Connection
**What it means:** Your SRE agent runs as an MCP server, and you connect to it using:
- MCP-compatible clients (like Claude Desktop with MCP support)
- Custom Python MCP client scripts
- Direct protocol connections

**Example:** You run `mcp-client connect sre-agent` and interact via text commands

## 7.2 Integration with Existing Tools
**Options available:**
- **Claude Desktop:** Install your agent as an MCP server that Claude Desktop can call
- **VS Code Extensions:** MCP extensions that can call your agent functions
- **Other AI Tools:** Any tool that supports MCP protocol (Cursor, etc.)

**Example:** In Claude Desktop, you type "analyze my EC2 vulnerabilities" and it calls your MCP functions

## 7.4 CLI Tool Options
**Simple CLI:** 
```bash
sre-agent get-vulnerabilities --instance-id i-1234567
sre-agent patch-analysis --criticality high
```

**Interactive CLI:**
```bash
sre-agent interactive
> analyze vulnerabilities for web servers
> schedule patches for low-load windows
```

**MCP-powered CLI:** Combines MCP server with command-line interface

## 7.5 Slack/Teams Integration
**Slack Bot:**
- `/sre-vulnerability-check` - Get vulnerability summary
- `/sre-patch-status` - Check patch compliance
- Automated alerts for critical findings

**Teams Bot:**
- Similar commands in Teams format
- Rich cards showing vulnerability data
- Approval workflows via Teams buttons

## Recommended Combination
Based on your answers, I suggest:
1. **Slack/Teams integration** (you said yes to both)
2. **Simple CLI tool** for direct SRE team use
3. **Claude Desktop integration** for advanced analysis

Would this combination work for your team?
