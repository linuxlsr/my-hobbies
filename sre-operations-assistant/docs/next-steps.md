  - `/sre-patch-status [instance-id]`
  - `/sre-security-events [time-range]`
- [ ] Implement interactive workflows for patch approval
- [ ] Add rich formatting for vulnerability reports

## Week 2 Implementation

### 4. Automation & Safety Controls
**Priority: High**
- [ ] Implement automated patching with rollback:
  - `execute_automated_patching()`
  - `rollback_changes()`
- [ ] Create approval workflow system:
  - `create_approval_workflow()`
  - Integration with Slack for approvals

### 5. CLI Tool Development
**Priority: Medium** ✅ COMPLETED

  - Basic commands: `analyze`, `schedule`, `monitor`
  - Interactive natural language mode
- [x] Add configuration management for CLI
- [x] Remote and local mode support
- [x] Comprehensive testing suite

### 6. Monitoring & Alerting
**Priority: Medium** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Security event monitoring (`monitor_security_events()`)
- [x] Configuration change analysis (`analyze_configuration_changes()`)
- [x] Create health check endpoints
- [x] Set up SNS for multi-channel alerting (infrastructure)
- [x] CloudTrail event analysis (`analyze_cloudtrail_events()`)
- [x] CloudWatch Dashboard with visual metrics
- [x] Custom metrics collection (vulnerabilities, patch compliance)
- [x] Automated alarms for critical thresholds
- [x] Scheduled metrics collection every 5 minutes

## Infrastructure & Deployment

### 7. Production Infrastructure
**Priority: High** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Dockerfile updated for MCP server with core functions
- [x] ECS deployment scripts created (deploy.bat, deploy-mcp-server.ps1)
- [x] MCP server successfully deployed to ECS:
- [x] Terraform infrastructure already deployed
- [x] Core MCP functions now running in production ECS
- [x] Secrets Manager integration for API tokens
- [x] Advanced MCP functions implemented:
  - Vulnerability resolution by criticality
  - Patch compliance checking
  - Security event monitoring
  - Configuration change analysis

### 8. Security Implementation
**Priority: Critical** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement least privilege IAM policies
- [x] Add input validation and sanitization
- [x] Set up rate limiting and throttling (API Gateway)
- [x] Configure audit logging (CloudTrail)
- [x] WAF protection implemented
- [x] HTTPS-only access enforced
- [x] SSL certificate management

## Testing & Validation

### 9. Testing Framework
**Priority: Medium**
- [ ] Unit tests for all MCP functions
- [ ] Integration tests with AWS services
- [ ] End-to-end testing with Slack bot
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent operations

### 10. Documentation
**Priority: Low** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] API documentation for MCP functions
- [x] User guide for Slack commands (README)
- [x] CLI tool documentation
- [x] Deployment runbook (DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [x] Architecture documentation
- [x] Troubleshooting guide
- [x] Development guide

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### 11. Advanced Features
- [ ] Teams bot integration
- [ ] Multi-account support
- [ ] Advanced anomaly detection
- [ ] Custom remediation workflows
- [ ] Compliance reporting dashboard

### 12. Optimization
- [ ] Cost optimization analysis
- [ ] Performance tuning
- [ ] Auto-scaling configuration
- [ ] Advanced security controls

## Resource Requirements

### Development Focus
1. **Week 1:** Core MCP functions + enhanced Slack bot
2. **Week 2:** Automation + infrastructure deployment

### Budget Tracking
- Target: Under $100/month
- Monitor: Lambda, Bedrock, and Inspector costs
- Optimize: Function memory and timeout settings

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Rollback failures:** Implement comprehensive testing
- **Permission issues:** Use least privilege with gradual expansion
- **Rate limiting:** Implement proper throttling and queuing

### Operational Risks
- **False positives:** Add confidence scoring to recommendations
- **Downtime during patching:** Require manual approval for critical systems
- **Data loss:** Implement backup verification before changes

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 Goals ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] All core MCP functions operational
- [x] Enhanced Slack bot with 3+ commands
- [x] Basic infrastructure deployed
- [x] HTTPS-only security implemented
- [x] CLI tool fully functional

### Week 2 Goals ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Production infrastructure deployed
- [x] CLI tool functional with natural language
- [x] Production monitoring active
