# SRE Operations Assistant - Next Steps

## Current Status ✅
- [x] SRE agent with scan-all functionality implemented
- [x] Vulnerability check function working
- [x] Single instance vulnerability check in Slack bot operational

## Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)

### 1. Core MCP Function Expansion
**Priority: High** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement remaining MCP functions from spec:
  - `get_ec2_cloudwatch_metrics()` - EC2 performance monitoring
  - `analyze_cloudtrail_events()` - Security event analysis
  - `monitor_security_events()` - Real-time security monitoring
  - `analyze_configuration_changes()` - Config drift detection

### 2. Enhanced Vulnerability Management
**Priority: High**
- [ ] Add criticality-based vulnerability resolution:
  - `resolve_vulnerabilities_by_criticality()`
  - `analyze_optimal_patch_window()`
- [ ] Implement patch compliance checking:
  - `check_patch_compliance()`
  - `generate_vulnerability_report()`

### 3. Slack Bot Enhancement
**Priority: Medium**
- [ ] Add missing Slack commands:
  - `/sre-patch-status [instance-id]`
  - `/sre-security-events [time-range]`
- [ ] Implement interactive workflows for patch approval
- [ ] Add rich formatting for vulnerability reports

## Week 2 Implementation

### 4. Automation & Safety Controls
**Priority: High**
- [ ] Implement automated patching with rollback:
  - `execute_automated_patching()`
  - `rollback_changes()`
- [ ] Create approval workflow system:
  - `create_approval_workflow()`
  - Integration with Slack for approvals

### 5. CLI Tool Development
**Priority: Medium**
- [ ] Build MCP-powered CLI interface:
  - Basic commands: `analyze`, `schedule`, `monitor`
  - Interactive natural language mode
- [ ] Add configuration management for CLI

### 6. Monitoring & Alerting
**Priority: Medium**
- [ ] Implement CloudWatch metrics collection
- [ ] Set up SNS for multi-channel alerting
- [ ] Create health check endpoints

## Infrastructure & Deployment

### 7. Production Infrastructure
**Priority: High** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Dockerfile updated for MCP server with core functions
- [x] ECS deployment scripts created (deploy.bat, deploy-mcp-server.ps1)
- [x] MCP server successfully deployed to ECS:
- [x] Terraform infrastructure already deployed
- [x] Core MCP functions now running in production ECS
- [ ] Secrets Manager integration for API tokens

### 8. Security Implementation
**Priority: Critical**
- [ ] Implement least privilege IAM policies
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Set up rate limiting and throttling
- [ ] Configure audit logging

## Testing & Validation

### 9. Testing Framework
**Priority: Medium**
- [ ] Unit tests for all MCP functions
- [ ] Integration tests with AWS services
- [ ] End-to-end testing with Slack bot
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent operations

### 10. Documentation
**Priority: Low**
- [ ] API documentation for MCP functions
- [ ] User guide for Slack commands
- [ ] CLI tool documentation
- [ ] Deployment runbook

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### 11. Advanced Features
- [ ] Teams bot integration
- [ ] Multi-account support
- [ ] Advanced anomaly detection
- [ ] Custom remediation workflows
- [ ] Compliance reporting dashboard

### 12. Optimization
- [ ] Cost optimization analysis
- [ ] Performance tuning
- [ ] Auto-scaling configuration
- [ ] Advanced security controls

## Resource Requirements

### Development Focus
1. **Week 1:** Core MCP functions + enhanced Slack bot
2. **Week 2:** Automation + infrastructure deployment

### Budget Tracking
- Target: Under $100/month
- Monitor: Lambda, Bedrock, and Inspector costs
- Optimize: Function memory and timeout settings

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Rollback failures:** Implement comprehensive testing
- **Permission issues:** Use least privilege with gradual expansion
- **Rate limiting:** Implement proper throttling and queuing

### Operational Risks
- **False positives:** Add confidence scoring to recommendations
- **Downtime during patching:** Require manual approval for critical systems
- **Data loss:** Implement backup verification before changes

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 Goals
- All core MCP functions operational
- Enhanced Slack bot with 3+ commands
- Basic infrastructure deployed

### Week 2 Goals
- Automated patching with rollback capability
- CLI tool functional
- Production monitoring active
- Under budget target

## Next Actions
1. Prioritize MCP function implementation based on current Slack bot success
2. Set up development environment for remaining functions
3. Begin Terraform infrastructure planning
4. Schedule testing phases for each component
